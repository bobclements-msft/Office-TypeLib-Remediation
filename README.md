# Office TypeLib Remediation
In some circumstances, devices that have had a previously installed 32-bit Office version may have leftover registry keys that interfere with COM and .Net functionality with a 64-bit Office version. Generally, these issues occur when the COM or .NET client is running as a 32-bit process. This project addresses remediation for these COM and .NET issues between 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Office.
